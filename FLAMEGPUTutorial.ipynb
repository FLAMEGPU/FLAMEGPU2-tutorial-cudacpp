    "# The Predator-Prey Model\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Predator prey models capture the dynamic behaviours of competing species within an environment to demonstrate population dynamics as species try to survive. The model is important as it captures emergent macro level phenomenon which can be observed within other domains such as economics. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In its most basic form, a two species system consists of both prey and predators. Prey reproduce but are eaten by predators and predators reproduce and eat prey.  Typically such systems can be represented using non linear differential equations known as Lotka-Volterra equations. In a more advanced form of the model, microscopic behaviours of the species can be considered by using agent based representation. E.g. The predators can have energy which is depleted as they move. Prey can form cohesive groups (flocking) and dynamically avoid predators, while predators can move towards prey. If a predator and prey are close enough (i.e. within a fixed kill radius), the predator is able to eat the prey and increase the amount of energy it has. Predators die when they run out of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model has been implemented in various Agent Based Modelling frameworks (e.g:NetLogo and FLAME). The tutorial model implements the following behaviours:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Predator and Prey agents move and act in a sequence of iterations (time steps).\n",
    "* Predator and Prey agents have real valued (x, y) positions and velocities which are integrated over time.\n",
    "* Predator agents have an initial velocity. A Predator adjusts its velocity to follow the nearest prey within a synthetic limited vision.\n",
    "* A predator’s energy is reduced by 1 unit of energy each time it moves.\n",
    "* Prey are eaten by the closest predator agent within a fixed (kill) radius.\n",
    "* A predator’s energy increases each time it catches a prey.\n",
    "* A predator dies if it has run out of energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "More specific details of the model features are described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Prey catching__\n",
    "There is no limit on the amount of prey a predator can eat per iteration. If a predator is close to multiple prey within the specific (kill) radius, the predator will kill/eat them all. A prey cannot be shared between multiple predators. If there are multiple predators within the kill radius then only the closest will eat the prey.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Reproduction__\n",
    "Each species has a rate of reproduction. When an agent reproduces, the parent’s energy is shared evenly between parent and child, so both will have half of the parent’s energy for the next iteration."

    "## FLAMEGPU2 Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The FLAMEGPU implementation of the predator prey model is based on the assumptions made in the previous section. All agents have a real valued position (`x`,  `y`) within a continuous environment. The environment bounds are wrapped to form a continuous toroidal space in which agents can move. Agents have a velocity (`vx` and `vy`) in which they will move and a steering velocity (`steer_x` and `steer_y`) which dictates how they should adjust their velocity according to local interactions.Predator agents have a variable (`life`) which contains their level of energy. An agent variable `type` is used for visualisations of the simulation where unique type values correspond to different colours within the visualisation. The type is set by the initial values of the agent and does not change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each agent has a unique identifier variable (`id`). When a predator kills a prey, it is necessary to communicate identifiers to ensure correct behaviour as will be explained later in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "All communication between agents in FLAMEGPU2 is performed indirectly via messages. In this model we have three message types which are required to perform the mechanism for killing. E.g,\n",
    "\n",
    "*  Both prey and predators output their (x, y) coordinates to a prey or predator location message respectively. \n",
    "*  Prey read predator locations and perform evasive behaviour to avoid them.\n",
    "*  Predators read prey locations and move towards the closest visible prey.\n",
    "*  Prey read each others location and move towards each other to form cohesive groups.\n",
    "*  Both predators and prey read their own species' locations to avoid each other when in close proximity.\n",
    "*  Prey read the locations of predators and calculate the nearest predator within the kill distance. If a predator is within the kill distance then it notifies this predator by sending a `prey_eaten_message` message with the predator's `id` and the eaten prey dies (is removed for the simulation).\n",
    "*  Predators read the `prey_eaten_message` messages and check the to see if their `id` has been communicated by any dead prey. If the message indicates that the predator ate some prey, then the predator increases its energy/life accordingly."

    "Functions can be applied to agents in a specified initial\\_state and can optionally cause agents to move to other states. As our model is relatively simple, we only use a single default state. Furthermore, functions can have conditions. For example, a function which simulates agent death might check a variable incremented each iteration called life-cycles to see if it has reached a maximum number. Only agents meeting this condition would perform the behaviour and move into a dead state.  The predator-prey model is a stateless model (each agent has only a single state) as functions do not require any function conditions. The dependencies and order of functions is described within the models function layers which dictate the ordering of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions can have either a single input or output (or neither). Inputs and outputs are in the form of messages which are a collection of variables which are persistent from the point in which they are output to the end of the simulation iteration (at which point they are destroyed). A function description within a model requires that any inputs or outputs are fully specified. \n",

    "For simple functions such as the one above, we can use `.setMessageOutput` or `.setMessageInput` to set a single property as the function is created. For more complex functions with multiple properties, we can make use of `newFunction` returning a reference to our newly-created function. The code below shows the declaration of a function called `prey_eaten` which has `predator_location_message` as input, `prey_eaten_message` as output, may or may not output a message and can result in the agent dying.\n",

Spatial partitioning is simple to use in FLAMEGPU2, although we will use the simplest messaging type, `MessageBruteForce` which features no partitioning.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* A prey’s energy is reduced by 1 unit each time it moves.\n",
    "* A prey’s energy increases each time it eats grass.\n",
    "* A prey dies if it has run out of energy.\n",
    "* Once eaten, grass regrows after a fixed number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "With respect to the implementation this will require , a fourth and fifth message type as grass should only be eaten by prey within a certain certain radius. The mechanism for \"grazing\" is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Grass agents which currently are currently available read the positions of the prey from the location messages to locate the nearest prey. \n",
    "2. If a prey was in eating range, a `grass_eaten_message` message is output. Note that if there is more than 1 prey on within the minimum distance, the grass agent should be eaten by the closest prey.\n",
    "3.  Grass agents then modify the `active` agent variable to indicate they are in a regrowth period and cannot be eaten at this time.\n",
    "4.  Prey agents read the `grass_eaten_message` messages and check to see if any match their ID. They then increase their energy accordingly.\n",
    "5. Prey agents die if they do not have enough life/energy.\n",
    "\n",

    "For simplicity a Grass agent description and corresponding function descriptions matching the behaviour described above have already been added to model file. In this exercise, you need to modify the [`main.cu`](../edit/src/main.cu) file to add the following behaviour to the functions stubs described below (click on the filename to edit in the Python notebook editor or select File->Open).\n",
    "\n",
    "* 3.1 *__grass_output_location__*: each grass agent outputs a `grass_location` message to provide information. In a more advanced model prey agent can use this information to migrate to areas of high food concentration.\n",
    "* 3.2 *__grass_eaten__*: each grass agent should iterate over `prey_location_messages` and checks the distance between its location and the prey agent. If the grass is available and the distances less than `GRASS_EAT_DISTANCE`, then the grass is eaten by the closet prey and the regrowth cycle starts. Note that if there are multiple preys within the `GRASS_EAT_DISTANCE`, then the closet prey to the grass, eats it and outputs a message `grass_eaten` containing the ID of the prey who ate it. This behaviour is very similar to prey checking if they are eaten by predators, you may wish to look at the `prey_eaten` function for inspiration. Once the grass is eaten, it should no longer be available until the `death_cycles` reaches `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`. \n",
    "* 3.3 *__prey_eat_or_starve__*: each prey agent iterates over `grass_eaten_messages` and checks the ID against it ID. If the grass eaten message indicates that this prey ate some grass then increase the prey's life by adding energy. If it's life is less than 1, the prey should die. This behaviour is similar to the `pred_eat_or_starve` function.\n",
    "* 3.4 *__grass_growth__*: If the the `death_cycles` variable is equal to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`, then the grass agent becomes available and the `death_cycles` should restart. If the grass is not available (meaning the `death_cycles` variable is not equal to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES`), then the `death_cycles` variable should be incremented.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the case where grass is included, prey agents require an energy (`life`) variable similar to predators. This variable is randomly selected from the interval of [0,50]. Once grass is eaten, the `available` variable is set to `0` and it takes up to `GRASS_REGROW_CYCLES` iterations till the grass re-grow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Various values have been defined using `#define` at the top of the `main.cu` file for you which will produce sensible results with a correct implementation of the above behaviours.
